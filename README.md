# discord-bot


This project is a Discord bot built with Node.js that answers Formula 1-related questions by making requests to a local API running on the same machine. When users type commands like !ask followed by a question in Discord, the bot fetches relevant data from an AstraDB database and provides concise responses. Key features include real-time interaction, access to detailed F1 data, and local API integration for smooth, fast responses.
